**TIP** If you need also [noVNC][novnc], then you can use the image [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium], which is a member of another family of application images ([image hierarchy][accetto-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-wiki-image-hierarchy]).

***

This repository contains resources for building Docker images based on [Ubuntu][docker-ubuntu] with [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment, [VNC][tigervnc] server for headless use and the current [Chromium][chromium] web browser.

The images are part of the growing [image hierarchy][this-wiki-image-hierarchy] and they are based on [accetto/xubuntu-vnc][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc]. They inherit all the features and therefore not the whole description will be repeated here.

The `latest` image inherits among others

- utilities **ping**, **wget**, **zip**, **unzip**, **sudo**, [curl][curl], [git][git] (Ubuntu distribution)
- popular text editor [vim][vim] (Ubuntu distribution)
- lite but advanced graphical editor [mousepad][mousepad] (Ubuntu distribution)
- [xfce4-screenshooter][screenshooter] and image viewer [ristretto][ristretto] (Ubuntu distribution)
- current version of [tini][tini] as the entry-point initial process (PID 1)
- current version of JSON processor [jq][jq]

and adds

- current version of [Chromium][chromium] open-source web browser

The history of notable changes is documented in the [CHANGELOG][this-changelog].

### Image tags

The following image tags are regularly maintained and rebuilt:

- `latest` is based on `accetto/xubuntu-vnc:latest`

    ![badge-github-commit-latest][badge-github-commit-latest]

### Dockerfiles

The [Git Hub][this-github-xubuntu-vnc-chromium] repository contains the following Dockerfiles that can be used to build the images.

- `Dockerfile.chromium`  
  
  This is the main Dockerfile for building the `latest` image tag based on the `accetto/xubuntu-vnc:latest` tag by default.

  However, by providing the `BASETAG` build argument it is possible to build images based on other base tags, for example `accetto/xubuntu-vnc:lab`.

### Ports

The image exposes only the TCP port **5901** and therefore the containers consume only one TCP port (per container) on the host computer.

### Volumes

The containers do not create or use any external volumes by default. However, the following folders make good mounting points: `/home/headless/Documents/`, `/home/headless/Downloads/`, `/home/headless/Pictures/`, `/home/headless/Public/`

Both **named volumes** and **bind mounts** can be used. More about volumes can be found in the [Docker documentation][docker-doc] (e.g. [Manage data in Docker][docker-doc-managing-data]).

### Container user

Containers created from these images run under the non-root **default application user** (headless, 1001:0). However, the **sudo** command allows user elevation. For more description check the base image [accetto/xubuntu-vnc][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc] or [Wiki][this-wiki].

### Version sticker

Version sticker serves multiple purposes that are closer described in [Wiki][this-wiki]. The **version sticker value** identifies the version of the docker image and it is persisted in it when it is built. It is also shown as a badge in the README file.

However, the script `version_sticker.sh` can be used anytime for convenient checking of the current versions of installed applications.

The script is deployed into the startup folder, which is defined by the environment variable `STARTUPDIR` with the default value of `/dockerstartup`.

If the script is executed inside a container without an argument, then it returns the **current version sticker value** of the container. This value is newly calculated and it is based on the current versions of the essential applications in the container.

The **current** version sticker value will differ from the **persisted** value, if any of the included application has been updated to another version.

If the script is called with the argument `-v` (lower case `v`), then it prints out verbose versions of the essential applications that are included in the **version sticker value**.

If it is called with the argument `-V` (upper case `v`), then it prints out verbose versions of some more applications.

Examples can be found in [Wiki][this-wiki].

### Using headless containers

The containers are intended to be used through a **VNC Viewer** (e.g. [TigerVNC][tigervnc] or [TightVNC][tightvnc]). The viewer should connect to the host running the container, pointing to its TCP port mapped to the container's port **5901**.
